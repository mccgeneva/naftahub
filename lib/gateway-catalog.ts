// Gateway catalogue (server-safe)

// The canonical list of gateway account types and supported currencies. This
// module deliberately has NO "use client" directive so it can be imported by
// server actions (e.g. the admin config that enables/disables them globally)
// as well as by client components. The client store re-exports these so
// existing `@/lib/gateway-store` imports keep working unchanged.
