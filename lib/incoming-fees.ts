// Platform-wide INCOMING-TRANSACTION FEE.
//
// A flat 2% fee is charged on every inbound credit to a customer's Master
// Account — SWIFT-uploaded credits, gateway (Collect-funds) deposits,
// registered-account deposits, master-IBAN matches and reconciled inbound
// payments. It is DEDUCTED FROM THE CREDIT (the customer receives the net),
// and it applies IN ADDITION TO the 0.5% FX fee when the payment is also a
// currency conversion.
//
// Pure + framework-free so it can be imported by "use server" modules (which
// may only export async functions) — the rate/label/helper live here, not in
// the server action files.
//
// The fee is now MARGINAL TIERED (see lib/tiered-fees.ts): each portion of the
// amount is charged at its own bracket rate. The 2% below is only the headline
// entry-tier rate (the first €0–€100k bracket) kept for display/legacy refs.

// Platform-wide INTERNAL P2P TRANSFER FEE.

// top): the recipient receives the FULL amount and the sender is debited
// amount + fee. (Outgoing EXTERNAL/SWIFT payments carry their own separate
