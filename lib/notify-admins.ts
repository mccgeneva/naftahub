/**
 * Fan a bell notification out to EVERY administrator — the proprietor AND every
 * other admin — so ANY admin can see and act on a customer's request. Admins
 * are resolved from `adminEmails()` (all baseline admins + any ADMIN_EMAILS
 * extras) and mapped to their notifiable user records. Deduplicated by id, and
 * any `excludeIds` (typically the submitter and the data-owner) are skipped so
 * an admin acting on their own account is never alerted about themselves.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a notification failure must NEVER block or fail the
 * customer's underlying submission. This is the general fix for "only the
 * president is notified when customers transact — every admin must be noticed
 * and be able to act with the customer".
