/**
 * Server-side persistence for bank certificate requests.
 *
 * Certificate requests were originally a per-browser localStorage list, which
 * meant a request made on the client's device was invisible to the
 * administrator's approval panel running in a different browser/session. They
 * are now persisted in Neon, keyed by the owning user's id, so administrators
 * can review, approve, decline and re-issue any client's certificates from any
 * device. The client store hydrates from here and mirrors writes back, falling
 * back to its local cache when the DB is unavailable (e.g. local dev without
 * DATABASE_URL).
 *
 * The full request object is stored as JSONB so the rich document shape in
 * lib/certificates-shared.ts can evolve without migrations.

 *     issuedAt, approvedBy) while unioning the audit events so a client-side
 *     "Downloaded" event and a server-side "Approved" event both survive;
 *   - never deletes — clients have no delete affordance, and an empty/stale
