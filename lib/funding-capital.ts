/**
 * Project Funding -> Master Account integration.
 *
 * When an AES project funding application is APPROVED, two things must reflect
 * on the client's master account ledger:
 *
 *   1. The approved facility capital is CREDITED to the balance (once).
 *   2. The 1.8% annual debit interest (cost of capital) is CHARGED monthly —
 *      i.e. a DEBIT of `facility * 1.8% / 12` posted at the end of each calendar
 *      month for as long as the facility is active. Accrual begins on the EXACT
 *      day the capital is credited, so the first (and any settlement) month is
 *      PRO-RATED to the active days in that month.
 *
 * Because this is a client-side ledger with no scheduler, charges are accrued
 * lazily: every time the data is reconciled we post any month-end charges that
 * have come due since approval but are not yet on the ledger. All entries use
 * deterministic ids so reconciliation is fully idempotent (re-running never
 * double-posts).
