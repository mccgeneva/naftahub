/**
 * Guarantees Accumulator — pure, client-safe trust/risk scoring engine.
 *
 * NO "server-only" / DB imports live here so the SAME math is used by:
 *  - the authoritative server gate in submitApproval (app/actions/approvals.ts),
 *  - the admin Guarantees Manager, and
 *  - the client trust-score card.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FORMULA (locked with the customer)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Four risk factors are each expressed as "risk points" (0..soft-cap):
 *   1. Security Deposit Coefficient — how UNDER-collateralised the account is.
 *        secDepShortfall = clamp(1 − guarantees / (exposure × targetCoverage))
 *        points = secDepShortfall × 100           (0 when fully collateralised)
 *   2. Leverage Load — leverage borrowed relative to spare capacity.
 *        points = clamp(leverageLoad / capacity × 100)
 *   3. Exposure Factor — ALL outstanding financing relative to capacity.
 *        points = clamp(totalExposure / capacity × 100)
 *   4. Payment Penalty — auto-derived arrears.
 *        points = overdueCharges × penaltyPerOverdue
 *   5. Track Record — a NEW/unproven account carries provisional risk that
 *      decays to zero as it seasons with clean standing. This is what stops a
 *      brand-new customer (no history, no posted collateral) scoring 0 and
 *      taking a first high-leverage line for free. BUT posted, UNENCUMBERED
 *      guarantees accumulate to offset it: a new account that has put up real
 *      capital (paid-in deposit + net balance, i.e. NOT borrowed collateral) is
 *      not a thin-file risk. A financed deposit (e.g. a 1:5 lent deposit) nets
 *      to ~zero equity and earns no offset.
 *        seasoning        = clamp(1 − accountAgeDays / seasoningDays)  (1=new, 0=seasoned)
 *        netEquity        = guarantees + availableBalance − totalExposure
 *        guaranteeStrength= clamp(netEquity / provenCapital, 0, 1)     (1=fully proven)
 *        points           = newAccountRisk × seasoning × (1 − guaranteeStrength)
 *
 * They are combined as a WEIGHTED SUM, then the SQUARE ROOT is the risk score:
 *        weightedSum = w1·f1 + w2·f2 + w3·f3 + w4·f4 + w5·f5
 *        riskScore   = sqrt(weightedSum)
 *
 * The account earns a positive time credit that IMPROVES the result — it is
 * SUBTRACTED from the risk score:
 *        ageCredit  = min(ageCreditMax, accountAgeYears × ageCreditPerYear)
 *        finalScore = max(0, riskScore − ageCredit)
 *
 * An account is HIGH RISK when finalScore > highRiskThreshold (default 10).
 * Because each factor tops out around 100 points and default weights are 1.0,
 * a single elevated factor yields sqrt(100)=10 (borderline) and any genuine
 * combination of stress clears the >10 gate — so the threshold is meaningful.
