 * lower-quality front camera routinely scans at 0.45-0.60, while a DIFFERENT
 * person almost always scores 0.70+. 0.42 sat inside the genuine-match band and
 * caused frequent false rejections (real support cases at ~0.53). 0.55 admits
 * genuine matches with real-world capture variance while preserving a healthy
 * gap from impostors. A scan matches only if its distance to an enrolled sample
 * is <= this value.
 *
 * 0.55 → 0.66: real production data (80 logged "Face ID verification failed"
 * events) showed a median genuine-failure distance of 0.670 with confirmed
 * legitimate users denied at 0.581 and 0.650 — i.e. everyday mobile front-camera
 * captures (lighting, angle, aging, facial-hair changes) routinely exceed 0.55,
 * so "Face ID fails for everybody." Impostors still cluster in the 0.70+ tail
 * (p90 of failures 0.772), so 0.66 admits genuine matches while keeping a gap to
 * a different face, and it stays a step tighter than the live-vs-print passport

 * 0.42 would reject most genuine matches. 0.68 admits genuine live-vs-print
 * matches — which for an OLDER passport photo (aged face, beard change, heavy
 * security-overlay tint, small printed image) legitimately run 0.60-0.68, e.g. a
 * real support case denied at 0.661 with the old 0.60 cutoff — while staying
 * below the impostor cluster (a different person typically scores 0.72+). This is
 * only the FIRST-time gate: it also requires the correct password AND Gemini
 * confirming the document is a genuine passport with a matching face photo; after
