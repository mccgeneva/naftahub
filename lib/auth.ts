// within this window or it is rejected server-side. It also drives the cookie
// `maxAge`, so the browser itself drops the cookie after this much inactivity —
// which is what makes "closed the browser and came back later" log you out even

// forward on every authenticated request, so active users are never disrupted.

// iframe, where browsers only store/send cookies marked `SameSite=None; Secure`.
// `SameSite=Lax` cookies are dropped in that third-party context, which made the
// session vanish right after login (blank page / redirect bounce) in preview
// even though it worked once published at the top level. `Secure` is valid here
// because the preview and production are both HTTPS, and browsers treat
// `http://localhost` as a secure context, so local development keeps working.
//
// SECURITY: `maxAge` is set to the IDLE window (not the full 8h) and is slid
// forward by the proxy on every authenticated request. This means:
//  - the browser drops the cookie after `SESSION_IDLE_MAX_AGE` of no requests,
//    so a browser that restores cookies on relaunch can no longer silently
//    restore a stale session after the user has been away, and
//  - the absolute 8h lifetime is enforced independently and server-side via the
//    signed metadata cookie (see SESSION_META_COOKIE), so it cannot be bypassed
//    by the client even if JavaScript never runs.
