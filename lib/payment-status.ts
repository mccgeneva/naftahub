/**
 * Canonical THREE-STAGE lifecycle for every bank wire transfer / outgoing
 * payment on the platform. This is the single source of truth for the labels,
 * short labels, and badge styling used across the client Payments view, Bank
 * Statements, Transactions, the Administrator panel, and notifications.
 *
 * Stage progression (strict):
 *   1. review     — "Payment in Review — Awaiting Approval"
 *                   Submitted by the client, awaiting the administrator (and any
 *                   required Master/referral) approval. No funds have moved.
 *   2. initiated  — "Payment Approved & Initiated"
 *                   Administrator approved; the transfer has been authorized and
 *                   the debit posted to the sender. The funds are on their way to
 *                   the banking partner / beneficiary bank.
 *   3. delivered  — "Payment Completed — Funds Delivered"
 *                   Administrator has confirmed the funds reached the beneficiary
 *                   account. Terminal, successful state.
 *
 * Two non-progression terminal states are kept for completeness:
 *   - rejected    — declined by the administrator or Master.
 *   - cancelled   — withdrawn by the client before a decision.
 *
 * This module has NO server-only imports so it can be used from both client
 * components and server actions.
