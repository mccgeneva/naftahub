/**
 * Read-only aggregate count of everything awaiting ANY administrator's action.
 *
 * ROLE-gated only (admin email), NOT PIN-gated: seeing that there is work to do
 * is not a privileged mutation, and requiring the PIN just to light up a nav
 * badge would defeat the purpose. The PIN is still required to actually open
 * the panel and action anything.
 *
 * This powers a persistent "to-do" badge on the Administrator nav entry so
 * EVERY admin — including sub-account admins like a.koller@mccgva.ch whose
 * transient notification bell may already be marked read — can always see and
 * find pending admin tasks, independent of the read-state of their bell.
 *
 * The queues counted here are distinct tables/markers (no double counting):
 *   - pending approval_requests (all kinds)         via countPendingByKind
 *   - inbound SWIFT awaiting credit/booking         via listCreditableIncomingSwift
 *   - approved payments awaiting delivery           via countPaymentsAwaitingDelivery
 *   - yield / trading-fund early-termination asks    via count…TerminationRequests
 *   - equity-saving release requests                 via countPendingEquityReleases
 *   - client→beneficiary SWIFT routing requests      via listAllSwiftRoutingRequests
