 *
 * The fix: stamp a server-side timestamp here on every reset. The client (see
 * components/account-reset-gate.tsx) compares this epoch against a locally
 * stored one on load and, when the server's is newer, purges all local account
 * stores before the data providers hydrate. The server is thus the single
 * source of truth and a reset always "sticks", on any device.
