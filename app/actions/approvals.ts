 *   3. Stops all FUTURE monthly debit interest — the monetization interest
 *      reconciler only charges facilities whose status is `approved`, so a

 *      intentionally left in place, mirroring the commodity-revoke policy.
 *   4. Releases the instrument pledge — the client's `isMonetized` gate frees a
