/**
 * Server-side activity logging (login, logout, session, treasury, etc.).
 *
 * Client components do NOT use this Server Action — they POST to
 * /api/log-activity (a Route Handler) which is immune to Server Action
 * Origin/CSRF checks and therefore works on every domain. This action remains
 * for server-to-server callers where origin is irrelevant.
 *
 * Email delivery is awaited directly (NOT via `after()`): in a serverless
 * environment `after()` background callbacks are not reliably executed across all
 * runtimes/regions, which made login/logout emails send on one domain but silently
 * drop on another. `deliverActivityEmail` has a hard 8s timeout and never throws,
 * so awaiting guarantees delivery without risking an indefinite hang.
